## About this Project
-Every fullstack developer must know how to manipualate the exchange of information within a mongodb non relational database environment

-Due to this, i have learned how to make a social network api that allows users to add other users as friends, post their thoughts and react to thoughts of other people.

-This is only the api, request and responses. However, this is the back-bones of any social media website or app. Which can be then turned into an application using handlebars, allowing any developer to make a social media network with his own little twist!

This project uses
[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) Web Framework.
[mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) MongoDB object modeling tool, that can work in an asynchronous environment.
[moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) Library for parsing, validating, manipualting, and formatting dates.
